# How to install repository pacakge
- Download by using ```git clone https://github.com/symblai/Symbl-Twilio-Media-Steam-Adapter```.
- Get into the downloaded folder by ```Symbl-Twilio-Media-Steam-Adapter```.
- Run ```npm install```.

# How to setup
- Open .env and modify the following fields:
1. Add ```SYMBL_APP_ID``` with your Symbl appId.
2. Add ```SYMBL_APP_SECRET``` with your Symbl appSecret.
3. Update ```CLIENT_WEBHOOK``` - For local testing from a terminal or command line run ```ngrok http 9000```. Copy the secure forwarding value to ```CLIENT_WEBHOOK``` but remove the "https://" from it. For example if you got the value "https://dda80552256c.ngrok.io" only use this value "dda80552256c.ngrok.io". 
4. Update  ```TWILIO_WEBHOOK``` - Thre are two alternatives to update your Twilio active phone number and the ```TWILIO_WEBHOOK``` in .env:
   - Alternative one:  For local testing first run ```ngrok http 8000``` and copy and save the full secure forwarding address from ngrok to your Twilio account --> Phone numbers --> Active Phone Numbers --> select the phone number you would like to update --> Under "Message and Voice" in the "Webhook" value. then copy the same fowarding address to ```TWILIO_WEBHOOK``` but remove the "https://" from it. 
   - Alternative two (Shorter approach): To update your Twilio Phone Voice with ngrok link open a console or command line and run this command with your twilio phone number ```twilio phone-numbers:update <Your Twilio phone Number> --voice-url=https://localhost:8000```. At this point your Phone number Voice and Messages Webhook is already updated with the new generated value. Copy the same forwarding value to ```TWILIO_WEBHOOK``` but remove the "https://" from it.
5. Save the file. 
- Note: For real server testing - For step 4 and 5 modify ```TWILIO_WEBHOOK``` and ```TWILIO_WEBHOOK``` with your servers addresses similarly to ngrok steps above. 

# How to run:
- Run in your terminal or command line  ```node clientServer.js```.
- Run in your terminal or command line  ```node streamServer.js```.
- Now up to 4 people can call to your Twilio registered phone number and trasncript, topics and inights of the conversation will be shown in the clientServer terminal or command line.
